1,"Although the creation of Nunavut officially took place in April 1999, the Survey of Employment, Payrolls and Hours (SEPH) was only able to begin publishing separate estimates for Northwest Territories and Nunavut with the release of the January 2001 data. Efforts were undertaken to estimate the employment for Nunavut back to April 1999. These are available upon request by contacting Client Services (toll-free: 1-866-873-8788; statcan.labour-travail.statcan@canada.ca), Labour Statistics Division."
